                            <p>Self-harm is difficult to understand because it goes against the natural human instinct
                                of self-preservation. Maybe that’s why some people react to it in a negative, judgmental
                                way. They can’t imagine ever being in a state of mind where they would hurt themselves,
                                so they can’t understand why anyone else would.
                                <br><br>
                                This lack of understanding can lead to insensitivity and stigma towards people who are
                                often already struggling with serious emotional turmoil. Self-harm is usually a sign
                                that a person is having a tough time coping with their emotions. It’s frequently “used”
                                as a coping mechanism for unmanageable mental health symptoms, although the experts
                                don’t completely understand why some might self-medicate with drugs or alcohol, while
                                others self-harm.
                                <br><br>
                                Several mental health conditions are associated with self-harming behaviors, including
                                borderline personality disorder, depression, eating disorders, anxiety or posttraumatic
                                distress disorder. People experiencing these conditions might self-harm for one or more
                                of the following reasons:

                            <ul>
                                <li>To help manage unbearable emotions and symptoms</li>
                                <li>To help regain a sense of feeling (for those experiencing numbness)</li>
                                <li>To help relieve stress and pressure</li>
                                <li>To help feel in control</li>
                                <li>To reenact a trauma in an attempt to resolve it</li>
                                <li>To protect others from emotional pain</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            Any person can self-harm, but the largest percentage of people who engage in these type
                            behaviors are teenagers (17.2%) and young adults (13.4%). According to psychologist Dr.
                            Jennifer Muehlenkamp, “Those are the key ages because youth are experiencing multiple
                            changes at the same time. They’re becoming more independent and transitions such as from
                            junior high into high school or to college creates a lot of change. There’s a lot of new
                            stress and pressures.”
                            <br><br>
                            <h3>What Should I Do?</h3>
                            Self-harm seems to provide some level of relief from emotional pain, and can become
                            addictive. Like alcohol and other drugs, self-harm is a behavior that a person might feel
                            they need increasingly more of to feel the same effect. It could also lead to other
                            self-destructive coping mechanisms. So, if you or someone you know self-harms, here are a
                            few first steps you can take to change this behavior.
                            <br><br>
                            <h4>Seek Treatment.</h4>
                            Self-harm is a serious mental health symptom that requires evaluation and treatment. If you
                            are having difficulty coping with intense emotions without the use of self-harm, consider
                            talking with a mental health professional about one of the following treatment methods:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focuses on recognizing negative thought patterns
                                    and increasing coping skills.</li>
                                <li>Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) helps a person learn positive coping methods.
                                </li>
                                <li>Psychodynamic therapy identifies how negative behaviors have been caused or
                                    influenced by past experiences and unresolved feelings.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <h4>Practice Positive Coping Mechanisms</h4>

                            It’s helpful to understand what triggers you (or your loved one) to self-harm. That way, you
                            can implement healthy coping mechanisms to manage those triggers. Some examples are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Direct the urge at something else – Use a punching bag, scream into a pillow or rip
                                    up a magazine</li>
                                <li>
                                    Self-soothe – Take deep breaths, take a bath or try meditation
                                </li>
                                <li> Express yourself – Write how you feel or write creatively
                                </li>
                                <li> Create something – Paint, draw or craft
                                </li>
                                <li> Focus on music – Listen to your favorite song or play an instrument
                                </li>
                                <li> Exercise – Run, dance or just go for a walk
                                </li>
                                <li> Avoid alcohol and drugs – Substances can lower your self-control and increase risk
                                    of self-injury
                                </li>
                                <li> Self-harm is a challenging mental health symptom to overcome—and lack of
                                    understanding only makes it that much more difficult to work through. When it comes
                                    to serious mental health symptoms like self-harm, we need to show others and
                                    ourselves compassion rather than judgement. There is no shame in needing support and
                                    help.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
