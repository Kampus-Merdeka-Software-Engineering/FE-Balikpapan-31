                                <h3>What is Depression?</h3>
                                Clinical depression is a serious medical illness. It involves disturbances in mood,
                                concentration, activity level, interests, appetite, social behavior and physical health.
                                People who are depressed have trouble with daily life for weeks at a time.
                                <br><br>
                                Depression is a mental illness that needs to be treated. Although depression is treatable,
                                oftentimes it is a lifelong condition with periods of wellness alternating with depressive
                                recurrences.
                                <br><br>
                                Depression is common. It affects nearly one in 10 adults each year – and nearly twice as
                                many women as men. It is not unusual for individuals to have depression along with another
                                physical ailment or illness. In fact, this occurs in 80% of all depressed people: one out of
                                four cancer patients experience depression; one in three heart attack survivors are
                                depressed as are one-third of those with HIV.
                                <br><br>
                                Depression’s annual toll on businesses in the United States amounts to about $210.5 billion
                                in medical expenditures, lost productivity and other costs. Of those costs, $98.9 billion
                                were direct medical costs and $78.7 billion were due to “presenteeism” where employees have
                                poorer on-the-job performance due to symptoms that sap energy, affect work habits, cause
                                problems with concentration, memory and decision making. (Journal of Clinical Psychiatry,
                                2015)
                                <br><br>
                                A doctor can diagnose depression with a physical examination, a complete medical history, a
                                thorough review of symptoms and a mental status exam.
                                <br><br>
                                <h3>Types of Depression</h3>
                                <h4>1. Major Depression</h4>
                                People who have major depression have had at least one major depressive episode (five or
                                more symptoms for at least a two-week period). For some people, this disorder is recurrent,
                                which means they may experience additional episodes. One of these symptoms has to be a
                                depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.
                                <br><br>
                                <h4>2. Dyshymia</h4>
                                Is a low-level state of depression that lasts a long time. It is not as severe as major
                                depression, but can be just as disabling. Symptoms of dysthymia include many, sometimes all
                                of the symptoms for depression. Fewer symptoms are necessary to make the diagnosis. With
                                dysthymia, individuals are often able to function better. They might be able to go to work
                                and manage their lives to some degree. They may not even be aware that they have an illness
                                even though they are irritable, stressed or tired most of the time. Many people with
                                dysthymia believe that this is just their personality.
                                <br><br>
                                <h4>3. Perinatal Depression</h4>
                                A mother’s depression occurring during pregnancy and/or up to two years after the birth of
                                her baby. Often accompanied by anxiety.
                                <br><br>
                                <h4>4. Paternal Depression</h4>
                                A father’s depression occurring after the birth of his child and up to two years after.
                                Recent studies have shown that up to 10 percent of fathers experience paternal depression or
                                anxiety.
                                <br><br>
                                <h4>5. Seasonal Affective Disorder</h4>
                                Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is major depression occurring related to changes in the
                                seasons. SAD has a tendency to begin and end at about the same times yearly. For most people
                                the symptoms arrive in the fall and end around the beginning of spring. However, some people
                                have an opposite pattern with symptoms that begin in the spring or summer.
                                <br><br>
                                <h3>Causes of Depression</h3>
                                Depression does not have a single cause. Several factors or a combination of factors may
                                contribute to depression. A person’s life experience, genetic inheritance, age, sex, brain
                                chemistry imbalance, hormonal changes, substance abuse and other illnesses all may play
                                significant roles in the development of depression.
                                <br><br>
                                <h4>1. Genetics</h4>
                                People with a biological (family) history of depression may be more likely to develop it
                                than those whose families do not.
                                <br><br>
                                <h4>2. Brain chemistry</h4>
                                People with depression are thought to have a different brain chemistry than those without
                                the illness.
                                <br><br>
                                <h4>3. Attitude</h4>
                                People with a pessimistic outlook on life and low self-esteem who are easily overwhelmed by
                                stress are more likely to develop depression.
                                <br><br>
                                <h4>4. Gender</h4>
                                Women experience depression twice as often as men. While a specific explanation of this is
                                unclear, hormonal changes in women that occur during menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and
                                menopause are thought to be possibilities.
                                <br><br>
                                <h4>5. Life Situations</h4>
                                Difficult life events or traumas such as emotional, physical, sexual or verbal abuse;
                                continuous exposure to violence; financial problems or poverty; inappropriate or unclear
                                expectations; maternal separation; family addiction; death of a loved one; neglect; divorce;
                                illness; or racism may all contribute to depression.
                                <br><br>
                                <h4>6. During or After Pregnancy (perinatal)</h4>
                                Depression may be associated with pregnancy and the delivery of a child. Studies show that
                                15-20% of women in the perinatal period and 10% of new fathers experience some form of
                                perinatal mood disorder which occurs during pregnancy until up to two years after a baby is
                                born, and includes depression, anxiety, psychosis, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive
                                disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
                                <br><br>
                                <h4>7. Illnesses</h4>
                                Depression often coexists with other illnesses that precede, follow, cause or are a
                                consequence of the depression. These include mental health conditions, substance use
                                disorders and serious medical illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes,
                                sleep apnea, chronic pain, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, ALS and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.

                                <h3>Symptoms of Depression</h3>
                                You may be depressed if you have at least five of these symptoms occurring nearly every day
                                for at least two weeks:
                                <br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Feeling sad or empty</li>

                                    <li>
                                        Feeling worthless or guilty that you have let yourself or your family down
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Moving slowly or the opposite – being overly fidgety and restless
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Having difficulty thinking or concentrating on things such as reading the newspaper

                                    <li>Letting personal hygiene go – not bathing or not dressing well
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Recurring thoughts of hurting yourself or thinking that you’d be better off dead
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
